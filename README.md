If you're looking for clarity, you may have come to the wrong place.

This readme isn't for you. It's just a landing page with notes for me.

## TODOS

- make a function in neovim config to make it simpler to set a window-scoped property across all windows
- figure out what to do with intellij installs
  - may not be necessary for the time being since I haven't touched intellij on a personal machine in ages
  - I install intellij with a non-flatpak installation because it needs to be aware of other dev tools on the PATH, JREs, etc etc
  - this can be tricky because as far as I can tell, the bin scripts for intellij REALLY want to be in specific locations relative to the rest of the install files
  - maybe use selfman and make the install script something that creates a symlink(s) with an absolute path to the bins? or library it and add the library-ed bin paths to the PATH?
- configure niri some more
  - configure fuzzel launcher
  - play with keybinds
    - screenshot in particular probably needs some love
  - make sure bluetooth and wifi management is installed
  - for laptop: make sure battery management is installed
